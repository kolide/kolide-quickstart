# Kolide Quickstart Demo

The scripts and config files in this repository will enable you to quickly get a demo Kolide installation up and running. If you would like to try Kolide without setting up a production testing environment, this demo is for you. For guidance on installing a production Kolide environment, please see the [infrastructure documentation](https://docs.kolide.co/kolide/current/infrastructure/index.html).

The scripts in the demo assume you already have registered for Kolide. You can sign up for Kolide on our [website](https://kolide.co/).
We're also available to help with this script, or deploying Kolide in your environment.
You can contact us by email at support@kolide.co or by joining #kolide on the [osquery slack team](https://osquery-slack.herokuapp.com/).

If you would like to contribute to the script, you can open an [Issue](https://github.com/kolide/kolide-demo/issues) or [Pull Request](https://github.com/kolide/kolide-demo/pulls).

## Dependencies

-  Bash compatible shell with standard unix commands
-  [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

All other necessary dependencies will be installed via Docker by the scripts in this repository.

## Usage

### Start Kolide (and Dependencies)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kolide/kolide-demo.git # or download and unzip https://github.com/kolide/kolide-demo/archive/master.zip
cd kolide-demo
./demo.sh up
```

On the first run, a self-signed TLS certificate will be generated to be used with your trial instance of Kolide. Please enter a CN for this certificate that osquery hosts will be able to use to connect.
If you already have a trusted TLS certificate, you can provide it in this step.
```
./demo.sh /path/to/server.key /path/to/server.crt
```

When startup completes successfully, a message will be printed with a link to the Kolide instance. At this URL you will be walked through licensing and final setup.

### Stop Kolide (and Dependencies)

```bash
./demo.sh down
```

This will terminate the containers running Kolide and its dependencies, but data will persist across restarts. Use `./demo.sh up` to start again.

### Reset Kolide Instance

```bash
./demo.sh reset
```

This will terminate the containers, and remove the MySQL data and generated TLS certificate. Use `./demo.sh up` to start again from scratch.

### Adding hosts to kolide.

You can try kolide immediately by enrolling a dockerized version of osqueryd into kolide.

```bash
./demo.sh add_hosts <number of hosts> <enroll secret>
```

Example:
```bash
./demo.sh add_hosts 10 u5M9Y4T7u78rNHPI+dwEDXAC7XqPcnfx
```

You can run the command multiple times to scale the number of enrolled osqueryd containers up or down.


## Testing with Email (Optional)

Email setup is not required to demo Kolide. For those who would like to demo Kolide with email, `./demo.sh up` starts a Mailhog container that facilitates this. 

### Set Up Email

To configure Kolide with this demo email server:

1. In Kolide, navigate to Admin -> App Settings (`/admin/settings`).
2. Make up a Sender Address (eg. `kolide@yourdomain.com`).
2. Enter SMTP server `mailhog` and port `1025`.
3. Set Authentication Type to `None`.
4. Click "Update Settings"

When completed, the configuration should look like this:

### Viewing Emails

Mailhog starts a UI available at port `8025` on your docker host ([http://localhost:8025](http://localhost:8025) if you are on the docker host) for viewing the emails "sent" through its SMTP server. If email is properly configured, you should see a test message from Kolide in this UI.

### Osquery Enrollment packages

If you wish to enroll other hosts to kolide, the demo script can create an enrollment package which you can deploy together with the osquery packages.
First, [downoad and install](https://osquery.io/downloads/) the latest version of osquery.
Next, run `./demo.sh enroll platform secret`, replacing `platform` with your OS distribution and `secret` with the Enroll secret value from kolide.
Example with macOS package:
```
./demo.sh enroll mac oWdk+ub4BxVffVOgxrNOI18qfpZZtGFm
```

Currently we allow creating osquery enrollment packages for macOS, but are working to provide debian and RHEL scripts shortly.
